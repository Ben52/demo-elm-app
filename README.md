# Elm App

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

This is a small demo elm app. It uses [elm-graphql](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql) as an api.

You can check out a live version at [demo-elm-app.now.sh](https://demo-elm-app.now.sh)

To build, run `elm-app start`. 

It also demonstrates how to deploy a `Create Elm App` app to `now.sh` on their [2.0 Platform](https://zeit.co/blog/now-2).

Look at the deploy script in `package.json`.
